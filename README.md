# Job Tracker

## Run the app (required)

This is a Vite + React app. **Do not open `index.html` directly** in the browser — it will stay blank because the app must be served.

1. Install dependencies (once):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g. **http://localhost:5173**) in your browser.

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
